Entity - lives in world, contains reference to it
   Needs to have movement and idea of movement: It's position in the world shouldn't be known, only an approximation of it's movements
   Similarly, it's range sensor should have some uncertainty
   Implement with and without Kalman Filter

World - It's a world - 2D array of pixels
   Does this need to be an object? Or can the entity simply contain the world :)
   Would be nice to randomly generate at some point, so we'll make a World class

World representation - Entity's current idea of the world
   Can just be a 2D array of black-white. Whenever bot sees a point, it registers it in the world representation with a white pixel value.
